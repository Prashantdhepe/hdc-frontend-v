                  <div class="content">
                    <p>Today, student safety at school is of highest priority. When picking a school for their child, parents are very concerned, and the first thing that comes to mind is safety, especially if the child is a girl. The safety of children in school, in the classroom, and on buses is the most important facility that everyone searches for, but schools nowadays primarily concentrate on admissions without modernizing the interior facilities for the students. This can be in relation to any area of school safety, such as the safety of the school bus, the safety of the classroom, the school’s guidelines and procedures, etc. </p>
